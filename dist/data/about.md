# About this project

I have handmade this website using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/). The website is a single page application (SPA) that uses Vue Router to navigate between different pages. The layout concept is highly inspired by [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I'm using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [marked](
https://marked.js.org/) with [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) and [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) for rendering markdown content.

As this is being hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), the source code is available at [GitHub](http://github.com/ranierivalenca/ranierivalenca.github.io). Feel free to check it out.
