# Whoami

I'm Ranieri Valen√ßa, from Brazil.

I'm father and husband.

And I'm also **Programming Teacher** and **Web Developer**, both by passion (and profession). I'm BS in Computer Science and MS in Computer Science.

## What I do

I teach programming and web development related courses at [IFPE](https://www.ifpe.edu.br/). I have taught courses on **Object Oriented Programming**, **Web Development**, **Mobile Development** and **Distriuted Systems**.

Before that, I was a professional Full Stack developer, working with (at least):
- **PHP** and **Java** with **[Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/)** for backend
- **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** ([mootools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MooTools) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) versions 1.x for frontend
- **SQL Server** and **PostgreSQL** for databases

## What I like

I like to learn new things, specially about programming and web development, but also about physics, math, history, philosophy, biology, chemistry, astronomy, etc (well, at least these are the Youtube's recommendations for me at the moment).

## What I'm doing now

I'm currently working on a project backed by \[CLASSIFIED\]. I'm developing a DevOps framework with Python to automate the deployment of applications using Docker.

## My skills

- **Programming Languages**: Python, Java, PHP, JavaScript, Typescript, Shell Script
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, Vue.js, React, Svelte, Tailwind CSS, Laravel
- **Databases**: SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite
- **Tools**: Git, Docker, Kubernetes (learning), GitHub Actions
- **Operating Systems**: Windows, Linux (mostly Ubuntu and Debian based distros), MacOS
- **Languages**: Portuguese (native), English (advanced / fluent), Spanish (very basic)

## My hobbies

Parenting. Besides working and studying, I really enjoy my time with my family. 

I also like to write code and some articles about programming and web development. This website is a result of this hobby and will (hopefully) be used as my main blog (with reposts on [Medium](https://medium.com/r@anierivalenca) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/ranierivalenca)).
